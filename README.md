Welcome to Neo, the second-best i-Ready hack, compared to wang's demo menu and Nullify!<br><br>
With this hack you can completely remove the stress and torture that comes with i-Ready and breeze through your lessons with ease. This IS NOT related with the old version, which never worked.</p>

<details>
  	<summary><b>How do I send feedback about Neo?</b></summary>

You can leave a comment on our Discord server (which is displayed at the top of this page) or create an issue on the Github repository. Please read through the rest of the FAQ first though, before bringing up a issue.

  	<summary><b>The script isn't working, what do I do?</b></summary>

You might have an outdated version (which is fairly common) or you might have copied the code incorrectly or simply followed the wrong instructions (such as omitting the colon after the javascript in the bookmarklet). Please double-check your code. Before complaining, always consider one of these two possibilities. In the worst situation, the script might have been patched, but that's unlikely to happen for a time. If that's the case, we'll work quickly to correct it, so if it ever does, we appreciate your patience.

  </ul>

  <summary><b>Can you make other hacks for another programs?</b></summary>

We could but really our main focus is i-Ready exploits. There is plenty of exploits on GitHub, just check before asking. You can ask & we will keep it as an suggestion.

HUGE credit to wang-fr for creating the Lesson Skipper. This hack wouldn't be as great as it is without their help.<br><br>
